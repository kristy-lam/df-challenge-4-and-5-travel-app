## Suggestions for Further Development 

This app can be a potential integration with other DFCorp applications and external APIs relating to travel, weather forecast or other similar subjects. Integrating with other DF Corp applications and external APIs can provide a seamless and cohesive experience, allowing users to access various services from a single platform.  Users can then receive more comprehensive travel information, such as real-time traffic updates, local attractions, and itinerary suggestions. Ultimately, these applications aim to enhance customer satisfaction and experience.

To implement those integrations, user feedback is of paramount importance. Market research on this could be conducted to see what relevant features customers would most likely want to have on the integrated platform. After development and thorough testing, new features could be rolled out stage by stage following sprints according to agile practices, and of course improvements and addition of features could be achieved continuously with every iteration of the development cycle.

Issues to note or risks about the integration could include GDPR regulations on data usage and security. As more features are provided in the application, measures to ensure that the collection and retention of personal data, its usage and protection are proper could require expertise advice from relevant teams such as the legal / data protection teams.
